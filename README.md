# HTTP Retry Demo

To reproduce the HTTP retry behavior after a connection is prematurely closed.

- [简体中文](README_CN.md)

## Introduction

As [rfc2616 section 8.2.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-8.2.4) mentioned

> If an HTTP/1.1 client sends a request which includes a request body, but which does not include an Expect request-header field with the "100-continue" expectation, and if the client is not directly connected to an HTTP/1.1 origin server, and if the client sees the connection close before receiving any status from the server, the client SHOULD retry the request.

If our service runs behind a proxy or a load balancer, and a client's request is **closed** before receiving any data from the service (due to an error or because the response time is too long), it may cause the browser to resend this request, potentially resulting in duplicate requests.

## Run it

```bash
# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/waivital/http-retry-demo.git

cd ./http-retry-demo

# start all containers
docker-compose -p http-retry-demo up
```

The server will default listen on port `8080`

Open http://localhost:8080 in the browser (test on Chrome and Firefox) and hit the `send request` button, wait until the request complete

And in the `./sharedfile` will be two records with same requid from different host
```
[Tue May  7 03:05:59 2019] Hello there -- hostname:258f4c03429b requid:5802516b94b4f
[Tue May  7 03:06:01 2019] Hello there -- hostname:81074f0d03d1 requid:5802516b94b4f
```
